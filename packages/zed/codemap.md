# Package: @open-pets/zed

## Responsibility

Pure Node.js package for managing the OpenPets MCP entry in Zed's global
`settings.json`. It builds published, local, and bundled stdio entries,
classifies installation state, preserves JSONC settings, and performs safe
atomic writes. The desktop Control Center and CLI compose it for global settings
management; it does not provide runtime hooks or use IPC itself.

## Design/Patterns

### Global Settings Path

- **macOS**: `~/.config/zed/settings.json`
- **Linux/FreeBSD**: `$FLATPAK_XDG_CONFIG_HOME/zed/settings.json`, then
  `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/zed/settings.json`, then `~/.config/zed/settings.json`
- **Windows**: `%APPDATA%\Zed\settings.json`
- All operations accept an explicit settings path for tests and callers that
  need a controlled location.

### MCP Entry Modes

- **Published**: `npx -y @open-pets/mcp@VERSION [--pet PET_ID]`
- **Local/Bundled**: `node ABSOLUTE_MCP_ENTRY [--pet PET_ID]` (or a validated
  configured Node.js command)
- Published versions and pet IDs are validated before they become arguments.

### Status and Safety

- Statuses: `missing`, `installed`, `disabled`, `needs-update`, `conflict`,
  `invalid`, and `error`.
- JSONC comments, trailing commas, unrelated top-level settings, and other
  context servers survive targeted edits.
- Settings are capped at 256 KiB; symlinks, unsafe paths, non-regular files,
  malformed JSONC, and invalid schemas are rejected.
- Existing files receive an exclusive backup after a fresh source check; the
  prepared temp file is atomically linked into place without replacing a target
  that appeared during the operation. A sibling lock serializes OpenPets
  writers, and execution aborts if settings content or existence changed after
  planning. Write support paths are restricted to the settings directory.
- Managed `enabled`, `env`, and `timeout` fields are preserved during updates;
  unsupported `remote` execution is stripped during correction. A disabled
  managed entry is not silently re-enabled by install; replace is the explicit
  re-enable operation.

## Flow

### Install/Update

1. Read and validate the target settings file with `readZedSettings()`.
2. Classify `context_servers.openpets` with `classifyZedMcpStatus()`.
3. Build a plan with `planZedMcpInstall()` or `planZedMcpReplace()`.
4. Apply the JSONC edit only at `context_servers.openpets`.
5. Execute the journaled backup + atomic write with `executeZedMcpWrite()`.

### Removal

1. Read and classify the existing entry.
2. Refuse removal for missing, invalid, error, or conflicting entries.
3. Remove only `context_servers.openpets` while preserving all other settings.

## Integration

### Entry Points

- `src/index.ts`: Public API barrel.
- `src/zed-mcp.ts`: Entry builders, input validation, and platform path helpers.
- `src/zed-status.ts`: JSONC parsing, status classification, planning, safety,
  backups, and atomic writes.
- `src/check-zed.ts`: Self-contained contract validation.

### Package Surface

- Package version: `3.5.0`.
- Main export: `dist/index.js` with declarations at `dist/index.d.ts`.
- Runtime dependency: `jsonc-parser`.
- Current consumers: `apps/desktop/src/agent-setup.ts` and
  `packages/cli/src/index.ts`.

### Validation

`check-zed.ts` covers path resolution, command construction, version and pet
validation, JSONC preservation, all status classes, disabled/conflict handling,
optional-field preservation, safe file boundaries, backups, atomic writes, and
targeted removal.
